# Ask-secret CLI candidate: runtime evidence

This records the opt-in candidate for [#1380](https://github.com/BotHarness/DeepSeekBot/issues/1380), under [Spec #1378](https://github.com/BotHarness/DeepSeekBot/issues/1378). It does not close the issue or accept [proposed ADR-0164](../adr/0164-private-input-candidate-separates-native-storage-from-qualified-execution.md). [The runnable guide](../dev/guides/private-input-cli.md) describes the dedicated Profile and synthetic fixture.

## Observed behavior

Pinned DSH `0.2.0-rc.1` ran the actual Bundle in an isolated local Host. The visible Web DM of a real PersonaBot declared three required confidential strings. The Owner submitted through the inline card, inputs cleared, native Credentials Service persisted one atomic grant, and the Bot received opaque references. Existing approval supported approve-once, rejection and a confirmed broad remembered allowance.

The immutable `http-status-v1` Node CLI consumed references after Host authorization and performed a real GET against the controlled loopback service. Actual Bot runs returned HTTP 200 in their originating DMs. The restarted fixture independently counted three authenticated requests: Owner CLI submission, a restored older Session, and reference reuse after another Host restart. An earlier Web submission also authenticated against the preceding fixture process. The authenticated fixture response echoed raw and base64 synthetic secrets in headers/body; the CLI discarded these and returned only status and HTTP success. Unauthenticated responses are generic and contain no echoes. HTTP success alone does not certify arbitrary remote authentication.

Another real PersonaBot tried the first Bot's references with broad approval. The Host refused the grant before an HTTP request; fixture counts did not change. A rejected ordinary bash approval also caused no execution. With the Human-approved Linux workspace boundary, ordinary native `bash` persisted `linux-workspace-ok` in `proof.txt`, returned `/workspace`, UID 65534, separate stderr and exit code 7. The native MCP Client read the same persistent file without ask-secret. Both calls and protected reference reuse succeeded again after a Host restart.

Actual packaged Owner CLI calls settled a three-field private card from stdin: pending → accepted → configured, followed by protected CLI HTTP 200 in the same DM. The existing ordinary `user-question-answer --answer-stdin` also delivered `demo-ok` to the real Bot; its existing status API reports expired after settlement, so an answered status is not claimed. Neither private values nor their raw Host error payloads are printed by the new CLI commands.

## Boundary qualification

The passive task-local fetch probe observed 38 actual serialized DeepSeek `/messages` bodies at the 05:06 UTC checkpoint, including requests after private submission and restarted reference consumption: zero matches for the published raw, base64 and URL-encoded canaries. The adapter's source was checked to establish that this hook sees the assembled body passed to `fetch`; the probe did not capture bodies or authentication headers. Later Human review-card setup requests are additional to this fixed evidence checkpoint.

The all-frame native Session/artifact scan at that checkpoint inspected 1,196 files, 498 Session events, nine request headers and 46 tool results. Synthetic values were present in the native credential store; there were no matches elsewhere in the isolated home. This includes ordinary Channel persistence, persisted model data/errors, developer logs and any created Spill. Only the exact root native credential store and task-owned synthetic probe paths are excluded; identically named nested files remain scanned, with regression coverage. These finite canary checks do not establish protection against every encoding or provider.

Deterministic active Docker qualification attempted exact Host-file and base64 reads, environment inspection and Docker-socket access through arbitrary commands. The Host file/socket and credential/provider environment were unavailable. Mounted workspace files persisted and Git metadata writes were refused. The stricter unowned command world additionally blocks network access; normal authorized workspace execution permits container network. Linked Host Bundle/interpreter/Profile paths and roots enclosing the Host temporary directory are refused. This is execution-boundary evidence; a model declining an extraction instruction is not treated as proof.

The PR attaches [allowlisted native Session events](evidence/1380/native-session-events.json) and [the restored Session's events](evidence/1380/restored-session-events.json). These are projected from all compressed native frames, preserving actual sequence/time, call IDs, declarations, references, approval links, HTTP status and same-DM delivery IDs. Raw Human/assistant text, reasoning, commands, paths, headers and errors are omitted. They complement the actual outgoing-request probe; a persisted request header alone cannot establish the complete model request body.

## Checks and limitations

- Build, lint, typecheck, formatting, bilingual release-ledger and Skill-ledger checks passed.
- Final focused checks: 18 passed across credential/CLI/export/DM/docs contracts, plus two export/scanner tests passed after their last changes. With Docker qualification explicitly enabled, all seven execution/MCP tests passed. Earlier UI/private-card regressions also passed; these overlapping runs are not summed into one total.
- The full suite is not green on this Windows host. Native bridge fixture cleanup hit `EPERM` deleting temporary SQLite files; the same 61-test bridge failure was reproduced on the detached base revision `366ade8b`. Other full-suite checks were not all completed, so this is not an assertion that every failure is pre-existing.
- An earlier retained QA Session failed native `REQUEST_EXTENSION` preparation while tool definitions were changing. It now resumes and completes ordinary native MCP, private input, existing approve-once, protected CLI HTTP 200 and same-DM delivery. The failure remains historical evidence, not an unresolved restoration claim.
- A published-build defect bundled DSH Scope's module-local Symbol and caused the second Bot's MCP registration to collide globally. Scope is now an external pinned peer. Two real Bot scopes activate the same namespace concurrently; the native SDK integration test verifies distinct tools/results and refusal after one scope loses workspace authority. SDK protocol probes also required per-owner container labels instead of a fixed container name. Windows native Shell selected PowerShell, so Docker now launches through native Subprocess argv. These traps are recorded in `dsh-dev`.
- Qualified ordinary Linux CLI and configured native stdio MCP retain their Consumers and approvals, without ask-secret. Guest executables must exist in the pinned image or authorized workspace. Windows Host commands, unrestricted Host filesystem tools, background Jobs, Git metadata writes, MCP HTTP and arbitrary credential consumers remain unsupported/refused. This is bounded compatibility, not universal CLI/MCP protection; Linux-server permissions remain #1386.
- The preceding Linux CI failed two docs-reference expectations; those expectations are updated and pass locally. The resumed full Windows run was cancelled after resource-heavy failures, and a separate prerelease-script check failed three packed IM-provider entry checks. No claim is made that every Windows failure is pre-existing; the updated Linux CI is the full-suite gate.
- No production deployment, external email, production IM receiver, server change or sibling slice was performed. Rotation/revocation and later lifecycle cases remain separate issues.

## Human review

Screenshots come from the real base checkout and candidate Host at 1280 × 800, Chinese locale, in both themes. The baseline is the prior DM entry point without a private-input card. The candidate adds a pending inline card and a configured state followed by the actual same-DM result. Existing native question-card composition and native Input/Button primitives were reused; there is no separate settings page or added design-system dependency.

| State                 | Dark                                    | Light                                    |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Base entry point      | [Before](evidence/1380/before-dark.png) | [Before](evidence/1380/before-light.png) |
| Pending private input | [After](evidence/1380/input-dark.png)   | [After](evidence/1380/input-light.png)   |
| Configured and result | [After](evidence/1380/result-dark.png)  | [After](evidence/1380/result-light.png)  |

The task-local candidate Host and controlled fixture are retained for Human interaction. Human feedback is required before extending other consumers; the ADR remains Proposed pending review, and the candidate stays opt-in. No new consumer family is implied by the ordinary nonsecret MCP qualification.
