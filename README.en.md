> **This fork is developing an independent Bot web product.** See [standalone/](standalone/README.md), the [migration assessment](docs/standalone-bot-migration.md) and [acceptance record](docs/acceptance/standalone-bot-test-results-2026-10-29.md). The runtime does not start or call DSH. Real Codex login, API/LAN Web replies and explicitly saved file-memory recovery have been verified; some isolation and boundary checks remain partial. Original project documentation and attribution follow; its complete feature set has not been migrated.

> The [GK50 candidate runbook](docs/standalone-bot-gk50.md) records access, Compose and immutable identities. Main Bot, delegation, avatars and product browser work follow the [expansion plan](docs/standalone-bot-expansion-plan.md), with a separate [acceptance record](docs/acceptance/standalone-bot-expansion-test-results.md). Registry publication awaits the release gates.

DeepSeekBot (**DSB** for short) is BotHarness’s MIT-licensed, open-source Grok Bot alternative, running as a plugin in [DeepSeek Harness (DSH)](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness). Create Bots for research, writing or coding and work with them like colleagues: chat one to one, bring them into a group, hand them tasks. They remember you, do things on schedule, and answer you under their own identity in Slack, Discord, Lark / Feishu, QQ and WeChat.

Bots use the model providers and quota you set up in DSH, and the machine running DSH has to stay online for Bots to keep working in the background. DSB is a different project from the similarly named DS Bot (npm `ds-bot`); see [how they differ](#deepseek-bot-projects).

## Install

In the DeepSeek Harness desktop app, go to **Plugins → Add plugin**, enter `deepseekbot@1.4.1`, install and enable it, and **Bot mode** appears in the sidebar. No DSH yet? [Get the desktop app](https://www.deepseek.com/en/harness/).

For command-line install, version notes and troubleshooting, see the [installation guide](https://deepseekbot.app/en/docs/installation/).

The original experimental Linux GUI Host Compose deployment is retained: Browser and Computer share Chromium/X11 and DSH owns its data. Its GUI, Chromium sandbox, online CLI and restart checks previously passed CI and its image was published. A read-only check found that the old container exited with code 0 at 2026-10-29T13:00:12Z; the cause remains unconfirmed and this independent-product task did not stop or restart it. The [original runner](docs/gk50-automation.md), [acceptance record](docs/gui-container-acceptance.md) and [deployment guide](docs/deployment-gk50.md) retain historical evidence and outstanding real Codex checks. The new product uses separate Compose and data; follow the fork notice above.

## What you can do with it

| You want                              | How DeepSeekBot helps                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A small AI team of your own**       | Create a researcher, a designer, an engineer. Each Bot has a name, a persona and a pixel avatar, and stays the same Bot across conversations.                                                                   |
| **Bots that remember you**            | Bots keep your preferences and project context and pick up where they left off. You can read and correct their memory, and sync it to other computers.                                                          |
| **Several Bots on one job**           | Bring Bots into a group chat and @ whoever you need. Hand a bigger task to one Bot to work on separately; it reports back and asks when it needs your call.                                                     |
| **Bots in the chat apps you use**     | Connect Bots to Slack, Discord, Lark / Feishu, QQ and WeChat. @ them in a group or message them directly, and they reply in place under their own identity; in WeChat DMs they can also send and receive files. |
| **Things done on time**               | Say “send me a log summary every morning at 9” and the Bot sets up the schedule itself, or set one to run every few minutes, hours or days.                                                                     |
| **Help on your computer and browser** | Once you allow it, a Bot can open web pages, click, type and take screenshots, or work on a shared desktop. You watch it live and can pause it any time.                                                        |
| **Ready-made Bots in one click**      | Browse and install Bots other people share in the [Bot Marketplace](https://deepseekbot.app/en/market), share your own, or send a Bot to a friend as a zip.                                                     |
| **Know what each update brings**      | After an update, Bot mode shows what is new; check for and install updates from Settings in one click.                                                                                                          |

<a id="pixel-avatars"></a>

### Pixel avatars

<img src="docs/assets/readme/pixel-avatars-crew.gif" width="660" alt="Six pixel PersonaBot avatars" />

Every Bot gets a pixel avatar made from its name, and while it works the avatar morphs into the tool it is using. Want to make one? Type a name in the [Avatar Studio](https://deepseekbot.app/en/avatar) on our website and download it in high resolution.

## Memory you can see

Each Bot's memory is a plain Git repository. In the sidebar you can read what it remembers and see which lines changed and when, and edit anything that is wrong. Push it to GitHub to use the same Bot on several computers. See the [memory evolution guide](https://deepseekbot.app/en/docs/channel-sidebar/memory-evolution/).

## DeepSeekBot (DSB) and DS Bot (ds-bot): two projects, different focus

The names are close, but these are two independent open-source projects. Both run on DeepSeek Harness (DSH), and neither is an official DeepSeek product.

- **DeepSeekBot (DSB)**, this repository, by BotHarness, makes each Bot a long-lived colleague that **works beyond the DSH window**: Git memory you can review, the Bot's own Lark / Slack / Discord / WeChat identity, schedules, delegated Assignments and a Bot Marketplace.
- **DS Bot**, [Fei2411/DeepSeek-Bot](https://github.com/Fei2411/DeepSeek-Bot) (npm `ds-bot`, also written DeepSeek Bot in its README), **turns DSH itself into a bot chat app**: a main Bot, Chief, sets up your team through conversation, a group admin answers first to keep token use down, and a Usage page shows tokens by time, Bot and model.

| Several Bots | @ whoever you need in a Group; Assignments delegate separate tasks with their own reports          | A main Bot manages the team; a group admin answers by default and calls in other Bots |
| Beyond DSH   | Bots join Lark / Feishu, Slack, Discord and WeChat under their own identity                        | GitHub connector                                                                      |

**Which one?** If you want Bots to work in your IM under their own identity, or to review and sync memory with Git, try DeepSeekBot. If you want a main Bot to walk you through building a team inside DSH and keep an eye on token use, try DS Bot. Both are open source, so read both codebases: [DeepSeekBot](https://github.com/BotHarness/DeepSeekBot) · [DS Bot](https://github.com/Fei2411/DeepSeek-Bot). For a longer comparison, see [the article on our website](https://deepseekbot.app/en/blog/deepseekbot-vs-ds-bot/).

## FAQ

### Which DeepSeek Bot project is this?

This is **DeepSeekBot (DSB) by BotHarness**: npm package [`deepseekbot`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deepseekbot), website [deepseekbot.app](https://deepseekbot.app/en/). DS Bot uses `ds-bot` and is a separate project, not a short name or an older version of this one. See [how the two differ](#deepseek-bot-projects).

### Does DeepSeekBot require DeepSeek models?

No. It uses the providers configured in DSH; availability depends on API support, model settings and credentials. Memory and chat history stay on your host, while calls to a remote model send relevant context to the provider you chose.

<a id="docs"></a>

## For developers

To run from source or contribute, you need Node ≥22 and pnpm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BotHarness/DeepSeekBot.git BotHarness
cd BotHarness
pnpm install && pnpm build
node scripts/dev-instance.mjs --home /tmp/botharness-demo --port 31967
```

More in the [local instance guide](docs/client-bridge.md) · [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) · [architecture](docs/architecture/botharness-architecture.md) · [decisions](docs/adr/) · [agent guidelines](AGENTS.md) · [Release Ledger](CHANGELOG.md) · [DSH docs](https://deepseek-harness.github.io/deepseek-harness/).

For real IM tests, the [shared QA App wizard](docs/agents/im-test-apps.md) configures independent Lark, Slack and Discord QA1/QA2/QA3 slots. For example, run `node scripts/dev-im-test-apps.mjs setup discord` to enter the Token privately; confirm the current exclusive window before each receiver start.
