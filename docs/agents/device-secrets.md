# Machine-local secrets for device QA

Native device checks and store builds need a few files that must never enter git: the Firebase
config for push and the FCM key (and, once added, the Play service account key), plus the WorkOS
social login client credentials. Each machine
keeps them in one gitignored folder, `.secrets/` at the root of its main checkout. Every git
worktree of that checkout reads the same folder, so branches and worktrees reuse the files
without copying them.

## What lives in `.secrets/`

| File                              | What it is                                                                              | Where it comes from                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `google-services.json`            | Firebase config for `app.deepseekbot.mobile` and `ai.botharness.deepseekbot.dev` (push) | Firebase project `deepseekbot-d3e3a` → Project settings → General → either Android app → download     |
| `fcm-v1-service-account.json`     | FCM V1 service account key, a backup of the one EAS holds                               | Firebase → Project settings → Service accounts → Generate new private key                             |
| `workos/<env>/oauth.json`         | WorkOS social login clients (Google, Microsoft, GitHub, Apple) for `uat` and `prod`     | [WorkOS social login clients](workos-social-login.md)                                                 |
| `workos/<env>/apple-AuthKey_*.p8` | Sign in with Apple private key for that environment                                     | Apple Developer → Keys (downloadable once), see [WorkOS social login clients](workos-social-login.md) |

`.secrets/` is listed in `.gitignore` and `.easignore`, so it never reaches a commit or an EAS
upload. A fresh clone has no `.secrets/`: copy the folder from another machine over a private
channel, or download the files again from the sources above. EAS cannot export secrets.

EAS keeps its own copies for cloud builds: the `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` secret file variable
(production, preview and development environments) and the FCM V1 key on both packages' Android
credentials. Cloud builds need nothing from `.secrets/`.

## How the app finds it

`apps/mobile/app.config.js` sets `android.googleServicesFile` from, in order:

1. `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON`, set by EAS on its builders (or by hand to try another file);
2. `.secrets/google-services.json` in the main checkout, found through `git rev-parse
--git-common-dir`, so a worktree resolves to the same file.

With neither, the app builds without push.

## Local Android build with push

From the main checkout or any of its worktrees:

```sh
pnpm install
cd apps/mobile
npx expo prebuild --clean --platform android
npx expo run:android --device
```

On Windows PowerShell the commands are the same, with `cd apps\mobile`.

`prebuild --clean` is needed once per checkout, and again after `app.config.js`, `app.json`, a
native dependency or `.secrets/google-services.json` changes; an `android/` folder generated
earlier does not pick up the Firebase config. Reserve the phone or emulator through
[shared device QA](device-qa.md) first.

## Store builds from a clean clone

Run EAS from `apps/mobile` with `EAS_NO_VCS=1 EAS_PROJECT_ROOT=../..`. Without it EAS uploads the
repository's `.git` history (over 1 GB of PR media) and the archive can pass the 2 GB limit.
`.easignore` at the repo root keeps the rest of the upload to the app. Profiles: `store-test`
(AAB for Play) and `store-test-apk` (sideloadable APK, signed with the upload key, so a phone
must uninstall the Play copy before installing it).

```sh
cd apps/mobile
EAS_NO_VCS=1 EAS_PROJECT_ROOT=../.. npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile store-test
EAS_NO_VCS=1 EAS_PROJECT_ROOT=../.. npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile store-test-apk
```

In PowerShell, set the variables first: `$env:EAS_NO_VCS='1'; $env:EAS_PROJECT_ROOT='../..'`.

## Rules

- Never commit these files, paste their contents into chat, a PR, an issue or a log, or copy
  them into a worktree. Pass paths, not values.
- `prebuild` copies the Firebase config into `apps/mobile/android/app/google-services.json`.
  `apps/mobile/.gitignore` ignores `android/`, so it stays out of git; delete `android/` before
  sharing or archiving a checkout.
- A new machine-local secret goes into `.secrets/` and gets a row in the table above in the same
  change that starts using it.
