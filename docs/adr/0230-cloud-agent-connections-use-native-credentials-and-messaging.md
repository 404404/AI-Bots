# ADR-0230: Cloud Agent connections use native Credentials and Messaging

- Status: Accepted for the UAT Host slice; transport qualified on two Hosts; bounded-work runtime qualification pending
- Date: 2026-10-18
- Issue: [#2155](https://github.com/BotHarness/DeepSeekBot/issues/2155)

## Context

A TOB cloud Agent is a remote service identity. A local PersonaBot can bind that identity, but importing its credential must not create a second local chat store, substitute for Human authentication, or grant arbitrary local execution. The protected local steward named Tob is unrelated to this cloud service.

## Decision

The application-defined `CloudConnections` owner stores public connection metadata, a history cursor, a policy revision and explicit local work policy in the existing Operational Database (generation 100). Secret values reside only in the DSH native Credentials Provider under `botharness-core/cloud-<fingerprint>`. No environment token fallback exists. Explicit credential import pins the complete public instance configuration and qualifies channel, organization, Agent and owner using the public authenticated identity endpoint. Credential-free discovery is checked before bearer transmission. Matching discovery detects change; it does not independently establish trust in a server supplied by the operator.

Native credential persistence precedes activating metadata. An interrupted credential write is accepted only after exact readback; a conflicting record is refused. Removal disables the connection and aborts active requests before attempting native deletion. A failed deletion remains visible and retryable. Reimport restores deny-by-default local work policy. Metadata and public management responses never include secrets.

`botharness/tob` implements the existing Messaging Provider seam. Its account is one channel-scoped remote Agent; its reachable target is that channel. The existing Apps/Bot connection UI and CLI bind it to a PersonaBot. There is no automatic binding or local Bot creation. Application-defined Source Event, Admission, Bot Inbox and Outbox remain the local authorities. DSH SessionEvent persistence remains the Agent execution history.

The initial transport uses bounded public HTTP history. Human and remote Agent authorship remain distinct. A delegated typed work request retains the original Human, target, capability, parent and deadline; replay changes to this provenance are a source conflict. Plain text/results do not independently wake the Bot, even when an existing Messaging grant or Channel bridge requests immediate ordinary-message wake. Admission and later source consumption check the current connection, bound local Bot, original-Human allow-list and request deadline. Authorized context collection stays separate from work admission; a different local Channel member does not inherit the target Bot’s work authority. The checkpoint advances only after Messaging acknowledges its canonical commit. A crash between commit and checkpoint causes replay through the existing source identity, never a skipped source. The cursor is a transport checkpoint, not a second message store. WebSocket delivery is a subsequent transport increment.

Text sending receives the existing Outbox's durable operation ID. A deterministic cloud idempotency key is derived from that ID, never from message text. Binding/grant fences run immediately before network send and after response. Uncertain responses remain `unknown`; this adapter does not turn them into confirmed sends or invent automatic retries.

Host management uses authenticated `cloudConnections` RPC and `deepseekbot cloud`. Credentials enter CLI via stdin; removal requires a revision and explicit confirmation. Application-defined `CloudWork` owns bounded health execution/forwarding, exposed by the Agent-scoped native `cloud_work` Tool and the authenticated `cloudWork` RPC/`deepseekbot cloud-work` direct path. Both invoke the same Tool implementation. The caller supplies only an operation, canonical Source Event ID and optional forward target; the owner derives original Human, channel, capability and deadline from that accepted source. The live Orchestrator Agent identity, active Bot, current binding and local Human policy are checked. Remote authorization must match the exact canonical request, and local authority is rechecked after I/O before execution. Import or message receipt alone does not grant these capabilities.

Generation 101 adds a bounded work ledger in the same Operational Database. It records request hashes, execution count and outcome, not another conversation store. A durable `authorizing` intent precedes remote authorization; `started` is claimed before the fixed synchronous runtime check. Recovery from `started` reports `needs-review`, never silently repeats the effect. An `outbox` result retries delivery, including after the deadline, without running work again. A durable `forwarding` intent fixes the single-hop target before transmission; uncertain delivery can retry only that target and cannot fall back to execution. Completed/forwarded records return their existing outcome. Current authority still applies to retries. The health capability reads platform, architecture and runtime version; it accepts no arbitrary command or file path.

Two isolated Hosts have qualified transport, removal, context-only authorization and crash-before-checkpoint replay through UAT. The new bounded-work owner has source tests; native model-mediated forwarding and its two-Host UAT result remain unqualified until separately recorded.

## Consequences

The connector can reuse the existing Bot binding, channel placement and diagnostics surfaces. Native secrets and local canonical messages retain their established ownership. The protocol v1 parser is pinned locally for the independent TOB service; changing that contract requires compatibility tests with both repositories. An old Host cannot open generation 100 or 101 without the standard schema recovery gate. No production rollout, automatic downgrade, federation or group-to-group bridge is implied.
