# PersonaBot creation and restart persistence

A Human creates a PersonaBot bound to a native Workspace. The Bot gets a DM Channel and a Git Memory Repository, and both survive a Host restart along with the DM history.

## Sub-features

- `workspace` registers a native DSH Workspace that BotHarness lists in its options.
- `create` creates the PersonaBot with a role and Workspace grant.
- `memory` initializes the Bot's Git Memory with an accepted HEAD.
- `restart` keeps the Bot, its DM and the Human message after a Host restart.
- `memory-location` stores a blank Bot's Memory in `<chosen folder>/<bot id>` when the Human picks an existing folder under Advanced settings.
- `bot-create-tool` lets a Bot create a blank PersonaBot from chat with `bot_create`: name, Bio, Tags, Avatar file, Soul, Core Memory and Memory location. It goes through normal tool approval; the card previews the new Bot.
- `memory-move` moves an existing Bot's Memory to `<chosen folder>/<bot id>`, or back to the default, from the Memory Repository row of Workspace Grants; the next DM runs in a new main session there.

## How to get to it (user POV)

- In Bot mode, choose `Create Bot` in the welcome letter, then fill in the form.
- In a Bot's DM, ask it to create a Bot ("make me a translator Bot called Tim"), then allow the `New Bot` approval card.

## Driving it with verify-app

The scripted journey owns its Host: it launches a fresh instance on a free port, drives the same `/api` calls the Client makes, restarts the Host and stops it.

- **Run.** `pnpm build`, then `node scripts/e2e-personabot-create.mjs --with-dm`. It prints JSON with `"result":"pass"` and `workspaceCreated`, `personaBotCreated`, `persistedAfterRestart`, `gitMemoryReady` and `dmHistoryAfterRestart` all `true`. CI runs this journey on every pull request that changes code.
- **UI, narrow screens.** At 375 × 667, open Create Bot, fill Name, expand Advanced settings and scroll the form. The dialog title and Cancel/Create actions stay within the viewport while its body scrolls. Submit and verify the new Bot appears, then send a real DM. Capture the dialog before/after; the scripted journey above proves the API path only.
- **Memory location.** Make an empty folder on the Host, then `shot <label> --bot-mode --click "New" --click "Create Bot" --fill "Name=Ada" --click "Advanced settings" --fill "Memory location=<folder>" --click "Create" --wait-text "Hi, I'm Ada"`. Proof: `<folder>/<bot id>` is a Git repository, and `rpc botharness/get '{"slug":"<bot id>"}'` reports that path as `memoryDir`. A folder that does not exist shows the inline refusal instead.
- **Memory move.** Send one DM first so the Bot has a main session. Make an empty folder on the Host, then `shot <label> --bot-mode --click-text Ada --click "Workspace Grants · Ada · 0 workspaces" --click-text "Memory Repository" --fill "New Memory location=<folder>" --click "Move Memory" --wait-text "<folder>/<bot id>"`. Proof: `git -C <folder>/<bot id> rev-parse HEAD` matches the HEAD before the move, the old folder is gone, `rpc botharness/get` reports the new `memoryDir`, and after the next DM `rpc botharness/botSessionIds '{}'` lists a second session whose `cwd` (in `<DSH_HOME>/storages/session_projcache/sessions/<id>.json`) is the new folder. `deepseekbot memory-move <bot id> --default-location` moves it back. The turn may fail for lack of model credit; the move is still provable.
- **Bot creates Bot, without the model.** `printf '{"display_name":"Tim","tags":["translator"],"soul":"# Tim"}' | deepseekbot bot-tool <bot id> bot_create --args-stdin`. Proof: the result has `bot_id`, `dm_channel_id` and `memory_dir`; `<memory_dir>/SOUL.md` holds the Soul; Tim shows in the sidebar; the creating Bot's DM shows "<Bot> created a new Bot, Tim". Bad input exits non-zero with `invalid-input`, `invalid-avatar` or `invalid-memory-dir`.
- **Bot creates Bot, live.** Needs a model. In the creating Bot's DM, `send` "Create a Bot called Tim, tag translator, Soul: calm and precise". A `New Bot` card appears in the DM (unless the Bot has full access or a saved rule); `shot <label> --bot-mode --click-text "<Bot>"` captures it, and `--click "Allow once"` approves. Proof: the Bot replies with Tim's name, Tim appears in the sidebar and `deepseekbot bot-trace <bot id> --turns 1` lists a `bot_create` call with outcome `ok`. Rejecting the card creates nothing. Last run (#1858) on DeepSeek V4.1 Flash: the card asked, `Allow once` created Tim with the asked Tags, Bio and `SOUL.md`, and the notice and Ada's reply followed. Seeding the prompt with `rpc botharness/channelSend` is steadier than `--fill`, and `--wait "Allow once"` only proves the card exists; scroll it into view before capturing.

## Gotchas

- The journey needs no model credential.
- `bot_create` returns `model: host-default` for a Bot without its own Model Plan; it still answers on the Host default model.
- `--locale zh` does not switch the Client language on a fresh Profile; read accessible names from the English UI.
- It uses its own temporary `DSH_HOME`, so it never touches a `verify-app` instance.
