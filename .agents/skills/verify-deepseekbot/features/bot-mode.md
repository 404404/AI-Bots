# Bot mode entry and the protected Tob

Bot mode swaps the native DSH session view for the BotHarness conversation view. On structurally qualified Web/macOS/Windows windows at least 961px wide it opens the [workspace](bot-mode-dock.md); other shells retain the original Bot mode sidebar fallback (ADR-0203). On the first entry into a fresh Profile, the product prepares protected Tob and opens Home. See [Home and Tob](tob-home.md) for the current first-run journey. Existing ordinary DeepSeek Bots and their welcome letters remain unchanged.

## Sub-features

- `enter` switches from the native view to Bot mode.
- `sidebar` is the desktop Bot mode sidebar: a `DeepSeekBot` header, pinned panel cards (one per Dock panel, Activity Center first with its unread count), the Messages Roster and Bot settings, in the column DSH sizes and collapses. A card toggles its panel in the dock and is pressed while the panel is open; before a Channel is open only the Activity Center card works, and it opens the full Activity Center page.
- `exit` leaves Bot mode with the header logo, which morphs into **Exit Bot mode** on hover or keyboard focus, and brings back the native left column.
- `default-bot` prepares Tob and its DM on first entry.
- `welcome-letter` preserves the older DeepSeek Bot welcome; fresh Tob uses a once-only fixed greeting.
- `getting-started` opens the tutorial checklist.

## How to get to it (user POV)

- Choose `Bot mode` in the global sidebar.
- On desktop, choose the logo at the top left of the Bot mode sidebar (its accessible name is `Exit Bot mode`) to return to the native view. Between 760 and 960 px wide, the native sidebar stays and `Bot mode` is chosen again instead.

The workspace rail carries the exit control and panel switches; the independent Channel list carries the Roster. Both remain available without a selected Channel.

## Driving it with verify-app

Preconditions: a fresh instance that passes `doctor`. For the qualified workspace run `scripts/e2e-panel-workspace.mjs` as described in [the workspace feature](bot-mode-dock.md); the old sidebar journey below applies to fallback shells only.

- **Enter.** Run `node scripts/verify-app.mjs shot bot-mode --name <n> --bot-mode`. The ARIA file has `StaticText "Messages"` and `button "Bot settings"`.
- **Default Bot.** Run the same command a second time. The ARIA file has a Tob row and Home; submitting from Home reveals `Message Tob`.
- **Canonical state.** Run `node scripts/verify-app.mjs rpc botharness/list --name <n>`. `bots` holds one entry with `displayName` `Tob`.
- **Observation.** Keep the page open and run `node scripts/verify-app.mjs observe --name <n>` before entering Bot mode, inside it and after exiting. A healthy transition keeps `client.state` at `shell-ready`; a visible Bot mode main surface replaces the native sidebar marker. Inspect the DOM and any first failure separately.
- **Sidebar and exit.** Run `BH_E2E_INSTANCE=.humanlayer/verify/<n>/instance.json node scripts/e2e-bot-mode-sidebar.mjs`. It checks that the Bot mode sidebar fills the column with no native `Bot mode` row, selects a Roster row, opens and closes the Activity Center panel from its pinned card (`[data-pinned-panel="activity-center"]`), collapses and reopens the rail, then exits and checks that `New Session`, `Plugins` and `Settings` are back. It waits for the Channel content, checks `shell-ready` before entry, inside Bot mode, with Activity Center open, with the rail collapsed and after exit, and saves `client-observations.json` beside the screenshots. It prints `BOT MODE SIDEBAR PASS`. Each invocation writes a distinct `attempt-<time>-<pid>/` evidence directory so retries retain earlier results. Failed runs preserve `failure.png`, `failure-aria.json`, `page-errors.json` and `failure-observation.json` (the failing step and bounded diagnostic snapshot) before closing the browser.
- **Exit by hand.** Run `node scripts/verify-app.mjs shot exit --name <n> --bot-mode --click "Exit Bot mode" --wait "Plugins"`. The ARIA file has `button "Bot mode"` and `button "Plugins"` again.
- **Tutorial.** Add `--keep-overlays`. The screenshot shows the `Get started with DeepSeekBot` checklist.

## Gotchas

- On macOS, Chrome can keep the OS language despite `--lang=en-US`; this journey uses a CDP language override so its English accessible-name assertions are deterministic. A selector timeout with a healthy shell needs the saved ARIA tree before diagnosis.

- `shot` waits for a `Settings` button with visible text, so it cannot start below 1024 px, where DSH shows the rail. Drive narrow widths with a Puppeteer page that resizes after entering Bot mode.
- The Bot mode sidebar is labelled `Bot mode` as a navigation landmark, so `aria("Bot mode")` also matches it inside Bot mode. Use `button[aria-label="Bot mode"]` to target the native row.

- The default Bot appears asynchronously. The first `--bot-mode` capture on a fresh Profile can show `No Bots yet.` with `Create the first Bot`. Capture again before calling it missing.
- `.bh-root` alone does not mean Bot mode: the Window Companion stage carries it too. `verify-app` waits for `.bh-root.bh-main`.
- The preview notice is modal and hides the rest of the page from the accessibility tree until it is dismissed.
- On a keyless Host, the native `Add an API key to get started` dialog can appear over Bot mode. `verify-app` chooses `Configure later` unless `--keep-overlays` is set.
