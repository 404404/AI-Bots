# Mobile UI/UX rules

This is the target design of the DeepSeekBot mobile app. Every new or changed screen follows it. Tokens and theming are in [ADR-0201](../../docs/adr/0201-the-mobile-design-system-maps-web-roles-onto-native-components.md); this file covers structure, screens, components and code rules.

| Manus     | The chat: one Bot is one contact, the conversation reads like IM, and action cards sit in the chat.                                                                                          |
| Grok Bot  | Bots and group chats in one list, with separate "needs you" and "new result" states. Approval cards with **Allow once / Always allow / Deny**, and the Human taking over the Bot's computer. |
| Meta Muse | A Bot profile whose identity and memory are visible and editable.                                                                                                                            |
| Slack     | Workspace switching, a row of shortcut cards on Home, an Activity feed with filters, and agent steps with a Stop button.                                                                     |

## Structure

- **Hosts are workspaces.** Each paired computer is a Host.
  - The app stays connected to every paired Host at once.
  - Home and chats show one Host at a time. The Host switcher is at the top left of Home: the Host name with ▾, tap or swipe right to open it. It lists each Host with its status and pending count, plus "Pair a new computer".
- **Tabs** are native (`NativeTabs`): **Home**, **Activity** and **Me**.
  - A chat is pushed above the tabs, so the tab bar hides while it is open.
- **Home** shows the current Host:
  - A row of shortcut cards: **Needs you**, **Working** and **Unread**.
  - One list of PersonaBot DMs and Channels together, by latest activity.
  - The header has search and **+** (new Bot, new Channel).
- **Activity** is the Human Inbox across all Hosts:
  - Filters: All / Needs you / Mentions / Replies / Done, plus a Host filter.
  - Every item carries its Host and can be decided in place.
  - Opening an item jumps to the card in its chat.
- **Me** holds appearance (scheme, accent, chat wallpaper), notifications, paired Hosts and unpairing.

## Screens

**Conversation row**

- A 48pt avatar on a rounded square.
- First line: title, IM channel badges and time.
- Second line: a one-line preview.
- "Needs you" (a warning `!`) takes priority over unread (an accent count).
- A working Bot's preview reads "Working…".
- Swipe for pin and mute; long-press opens a native menu.

**Chat**

- Header: back, a centered avatar and name pill that opens the Bot profile, and the Bot's computer on the right.
- Messages:
  - An inverted list. Messages from the same author within 5 minutes form a group, and a time separator appears after a 30-minute gap.
  - Bot bubbles are `surface`. Human bubbles are `accent` with `onAccent` text.
  - In a DM, `accent` is that Bot's primary colour (`AccentProvider` with `botColor`), so each Bot's chat has its own Human bubble colour.
    - A colour too close to the chat background or the Bot bubble (under 1.3:1 against `base` or `surface`, such as black hair in dark mode) is first mixed toward `fg` until it separates from both.
    - Message text on it always reaches 4.5:1. A light colour (white under 3:1, such as yellow) keeps its value and takes dark text. Any other colour takes white text and is darkened just enough for white to reach 4.5:1.
  - Bubbles use radius `lg` and are at most 80% wide.
  - Reactions are small chips on the bubble corner.
  - Delivery: pending shows at 70% opacity, failed offers "Not sent · Tap to retry", and sent shows nothing.
- **Action cards** sit in the chat stream and share one layout: title and explanation, an optional preview, then buttons.
  - Card kinds:
    - **Question**: lettered options, single or multiple choice, then Submit.
    - **Tool approval**: Allow once / Always allow / Deny. Details open a form sheet.
    - **Takeover**: a computer screenshot, then Take over / Done / Not now.
  - At most one primary button per card.
  - A decided card collapses to one line. A card decided on another device says so.
- While the Bot works, a status strip above the composer shows the current step and a **Stop** button. Tapping it shows the steps.
- The composer is a pill: **+** for attachments, the placeholder "Message {Bot}", and a mic that becomes Send once there is text.

**Bot profile** (a form sheet)

- Avatar, name, label and description.
- Actions: Message, Computer, Notifications.
- Sections: Identity (persona and standing rules, editable), Memory, Routines, Channels, Files.

## Components

- `src/ui/design/` holds the tokens and theme (ADR-0201).
- `src/ui/primitives/` holds `Text` (variant `meta` / `body` / `title`, and a tone that is a colour role), and later `Icon`, `IconButton`, `Button`, `Avatar`, `Badge`, `Card`, `SettingsRow` and `EmptyState`.
- `src/ui/chat/` will hold the conversation row, bubble, message group, time separator, action cards, composer, status strip and scroll-to-bottom.
- `src/ui/shell/` will hold the Host switcher, shortcut cards and activity item.
- `app/` routes, reads the Host client, and composes these components.

## Code rules

1. **No literal style values.**
   - Colours, font sizes and weights, spacing, radii and edge widths come from `useDesignTheme()` and `src/ui/design/tokens.ts`.
   - `test/style-guard.test.ts` enforces this for `app/` and `src/ui/`.
   - Files written before the rule are listed in it and leave the list once migrated; the test fails if a migrated file stays listed.
2. **Text goes through `primitives/text`.** Icons will go through `Icon` (`expo-symbols`).
3. **A new visual element is added to `primitives/`, `chat/` or `shell/` first.** The PR says why the existing ones do not fit.
4. **Interactive elements meet the touch target and carry an `accessibilityLabel`.** The touch target is `theme.touch`: 44pt on iOS, 48dp on Android.
5. **Lists virtualize.** The chat is an inverted list.
6. **Motion and haptics are limited.**
   - Motion uses Reanimated, only for bubble entry, card collapse and the status dot.
   - Haptics fire only on send, approve or deny, and submitting a choice.
7. **Copy lives in `src/ui/strings.ts`.** Internal ids and protocol names stay out of the UI.
8. **UI PRs show the change.** They include light and dark screenshots from the web export, and a native check on a development build is recorded under Human QA.
