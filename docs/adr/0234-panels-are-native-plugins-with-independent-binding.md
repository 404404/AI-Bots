# Panels are native Plugins with independent binding

- Status: Accepted design direction; implementation pending
- Date: 2026-10-19
- Documentation: [#2215](https://github.com/BotHarness/DeepSeekBot/issues/2215)

First-party Panels must become replaceable Plugins, and independent authors need the same public capabilities. We use native DSH Plugin/Fiber and Bundle/Profile composition, application-defined Services and live Cordis Events owned by their domains, and an application-defined Panel contribution/instance contract. This avoids a second package manager, event authority or Bot-specific code sandbox while allowing a Panel to outlive the selected conversation.

## Binding and placement

Panel implementation, instance, binding and workspace placement are separate. Installing once makes an implementation available; ordinary content can have multiple instances, and reinstall must not duplicate them. Messages and Workspace Control Rail retain their required-role cardinality.

A Bot-bound Panel inside Messages follows the current PersonaBot DM. Group Channels provide neither that Panel nor its open action; there is no implicit member Bot or member selector. A separately instantiated Global-workspace Panel may explicitly select a Bot or Channel, identifies its binding visibly, and retains it across conversation changes. An unbound Global Panel can present Profile-wide shared Tasks independently of the active conversation. Group-channel-bound means Channel binding with Group-only applicability. These choices do not authorize cross-workspace dragging of existing Channel subpanels or grant access to their data; ADR-0221's two-level workspace and current layout restrictions remain in force.

## Capabilities, notification and lifecycle

The owning Host module retains domain authority. Public commands/queries are Service Definitions, and public business changes are typed application-defined Cordis Events with explicit production semantics. Providers and notifications remain useful without a mounted Panel. Browser Consumers use the existing authenticated Typert/API Gateway or supported stream adapters; Host Events do not automatically cross into the browser.

The first foundation promises current-state access plus live notification, not a generic durable event queue, offline replay or exactly-once effects. Reliable automation must use an appropriate domain-owned durable contract. Ordinary Cordis emit does not isolate listener exceptions; each public producer must define failure handling and bounded diagnostics without confusing notification failure with rollback of a committed fact. Panel/Fiber cleanup owns subscriptions, callbacks and rendering resources without stopping Bot execution.

Memory observation must eventually cover working-tree changes from external editors, Shell and Git even without an active conversation. It reuses the existing Memory Observation and admission owner, distinguishes observed changes from Git commits, and neither promises one event per disk write nor invents authorship. It follows the first Activity slice rather than becoming a prerequisite for it.

## Native composition and replacement

Use native Plugin/Bundle packaging and installation authorization. Binding is presentation context, not code confinement; no additional Bot-local installation or execution permission layer is introduced.

For required shell roles, retain one effective implementation, a registered first-party fallback and a recovery entry independent of the replacement. Prefer native Slots' priority, conflict, disposal and render-error abdication semantics instead of last-install-wins. Native render fallback has a bounded error scope and requires a surviving contribution; it does not restore an old Client module after HMR teardown. The existing Dock Panel Registry's duplicate-id rejection is not already native Slot precedence, so the implementation must explicitly connect the seams and keep declaration ownership stable.

## Delivery and alternatives

The first runnable slice, [T1 #2222](https://github.com/BotHarness/DeepSeekBot/issues/2222), is an independent **VRM companion Panel + Activity + speaking presentation** using Three.js/three-vrm. Existing Activity facts drive idle, thinking, working, waiting and blocked presentation; “active” is not a new domain state. Speaking is an orthogonal Client presentation driven only by actual committed Bot output under its visibility rules, so a Bot can work and speak together. Text-paced mouth/expression/gesture playback is sufficient for the first slice; it does not claim phoneme lip sync or require a new TTS pipeline. Use available VRM expressions and supplied clips/VRMA, with neutral or text fallback when assets or rendering fail. Do not replay historical speech on mount/reconnect, duplicate sound across instances, or derive domain state from an animation. Retain reduced-motion behavior, hidden-instance throttling, owned GPU/resource cleanup and a measured two-instance path.

T1 also proves public types, real native install/dispose, explicit bindings, multiple ordinary instances, Group absence, current-state recovery and direct agent verification. It replaces the earlier proposal to prove the contract with the existing character renderer alone; it does not require migrating all overlay interactions, a character editor, wardrobe, marketplace or life-simulation world. Asset provenance and redistribution permissions must be verified for the chosen model and clips. Validate the runnable slice and obtain Human feedback before expanding.

The next slice, [T2 #2223](https://github.com/BotHarness/DeepSeekBot/issues/2223), is a **Global Task Kanban**, replacing the office example. One unbound Profile-wide board lets Humans and Bots query, create and update persistent Tasks through the same domain Service and authorization. A Task has a stable identity, title, description, todo/doing/done status, latest progress and update time; Humans can edit, move, complete and reopen cards, and Bot tools expose the same operations. A Task is distinct from Session-local todo_write plans and Assignment Sessions: creating or moving a card does not start a Session, schedule execution or prove completion. Reuse and evolve #1792's existing to-do Service, storage, tool and CLI with record/author/completion compatibility; do not introduce a second store. Notifications follow durable commit, tools work while the Panel is closed, and reopening/restarting recovers the same facts. Define explicit concurrent-write conflicts and coded refusals. The first board excludes external Linear/Notion integration, arbitrary schemas, multiple projects and automatic execution queues.

[Spec #2219](https://github.com/BotHarness/DeepSeekBot/issues/2219), T1–T7 and the [T8–T15 migration parent #2234](https://github.com/BotHarness/DeepSeekBot/issues/2234) with its children share milestone v2.0 and [Panel Plugins Project #21](https://github.com/orgs/BotHarness/projects/21). Tickets are published, but implementation has not started. T1's runnable validation and Human feedback gate expansion; the migration parent and children are explicitly blocked by T1. New Host methods/routes/tools require matching CLI parity in their own slice, including direct execution of Bot tools without the model. Delivery status and dependencies remain in the tracker.

We rejected binding-by-placement, a Group member picker for Bot-bound Panels, a custom Plugin package/runtime, and a generic replay layer in the first foundation. Native trusted Plugins preserve ecosystem compatibility but do not confine authored code to its displayed Bot. Separating implementation from instance requires a real public contract and compatibility work; documentation alone does not deliver that contract.

## Evidence and current-state boundary

The [source audit](../research/2026-10-19-panel-events-audit.md), [native packaging investigation](../research/2026-10-19-panel-authoring-dsh-mechanisms.md), [Cordis/Slots investigation](../research/2026-10-19-cordis-events-and-slot-conflicts.md) and [design discussion](../research/2026-10-19-panel-plugin-design-discussion.md) retain the reasoning and pinned evidence. They are static investigation, not runtime qualification. This ADR revises the authoring target of ADR-0203 while preserving ADR-0221's placement rules; it makes no claim that the public SDK, VRM/speaking Panel, Task Kanban, independent Panel lifecycle or Memory notifications have shipped. Existing #1791/#1792 authoring work and #2096 layout CLI must be coordinated rather than duplicated.
