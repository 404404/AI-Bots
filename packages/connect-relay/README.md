# @botharness/connect-relay

The hosted Connect relay Worker ([ADR-0241](../../docs/adr/0241-hosted-connect-reaches-the-host-through-a-managed-tunnel.md)). It links signed-in WorkOS accounts to Hosts and provisions one Cloudflare Tunnel per Host whose remote ingress admits only the device gateway (`^/botharness-device(/.*)?$`); everything else answers `404` at the Cloudflare edge. Application traffic never passes through this Worker.

## API

Every route except `/v1/config` takes `Authorization: Bearer <WorkOS access token>` from TOB's WorkOS environment. Refusals are `{ error: { code } }`.

| Route                                              | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET /v1/config`                                   | `{ clientId, deviceAuthorizationEndpoint, tokenEndpoint, zone }`, the WorkOS client a Host signs in with (CLI Auth) and the tunnel zone                                                                                                                                                    |
| `GET /v1/hosts`                                    | `{ hosts: [{ id, name, hostname, createdAt, tunnel }] }` for the signed-in account; `tunnel` is false after reclamation                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `POST /v1/hosts` `{ "name": "Studio" }`            | `201 { host }` with a new `<id>.deepseekbot.dev` hostname. `400 invalid-host-name` (1–64 characters, no control characters), `409 host-limit` (`MAX_HOSTS`, default 5)                                                                                                                     |
| `POST /v1/hosts/{id}/tunnel` `{ "originPort": n }` | `{ hostname, token }`: creates the Host's tunnel and proxied CNAME if missing, points the gateway ingress at `http://127.0.0.1:<originPort>` and returns the connector token for `deepseekbot connect-enable`. `400 invalid-origin-port`, `404 host-not-found`, `502 upstream-unavailable` |
| `DELETE /v1/hosts/{id}`                            | `{ deleted: true }`; deletes the tunnel, its DNS record and the link                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Without an allowlisted account (`ALLOWED_USERS`, comma-separated WorkOS user IDs, `*` for everyone) authenticated routes answer `403 account-not-allowed`; a bad, expired or foreign token answers `401 unauthorized`.

## Reclamation

Cloudflare counts inactive tunnels toward the 1,000 free tunnels per account. A cron trigger runs every minute and deletes tunnels that are not `healthy` or `degraded` and have been inactive for `RECLAIM_AFTER_MINUTES` (default 5), or that never connected within that time. The link and hostname stay; the Host's next `POST /v1/hosts/{id}/tunnel` creates a new tunnel and repoints the same CNAME.

## Configuration

| Name                    | Kind   | Meaning                                                                                            |

| `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID`      | secret | TOB's WorkOS client; access tokens must be issued by `https://api.workos.com/user_management/<id>` |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`  | secret | Account › Cloudflare Tunnel › Edit and Zone › DNS › Edit, limited to the `deepseekbot.dev` zone    |

| `ALLOWED_USERS`         | secret | Allowlisted WorkOS user IDs while testing                                                          |

Without the four secrets every route answers `503 relay-unconfigured`. The Worker is served at `connect.botharness.ai`, never on a subdomain of the tunnel zone.

## Development

```sh
pnpm vitest run packages/connect-relay
pnpm --filter @botharness/connect-relay db:migrate:local
pnpm --filter @botharness/connect-relay dev
```

## Deploy

Run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` at the repository root. The deployment script uses the
workspace's Wrangler and its existing OAuth login; `wrangler whoami` must include the account
configured in `wrangler.jsonc`.

Before deploying, confirm CLI Auth is enabled in the WorkOS environment used by TOB. Obtain
that environment's client ID and the intended **application user's** ID from its Users page.
The WorkOS dashboard administrator is a separate identity and may not have an application
user. Keep the allowlist restricted to explicitly approved users; do not use `*`.

Prepare the machine-local file `~/.config/deepseekbot-connect/cloudflare.env` with
`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`. The token needs
Cloudflare Tunnel Edit on the target account and DNS Edit on `deepseekbot.dev`.
Keep this file private and outside the repository. Supply `WORKOS_CLIENT_ID` and
`ALLOWED_USERS` through the environment, then run:

```sh
bash packages/connect-relay/scripts/deploy.sh
```

The script creates or reuses `botharness-connect-relay`, replaces the placeholder D1 UUID,
applies remote migrations, deploys `connect.botharness.ai`, and uploads the five secrets through
a private temporary file that it removes. It uses Wrangler OAuth for deployment and stores the
restricted Cloudflare API token only as a Worker secret. Commit the real D1 UUID; never commit
credentials, application user IDs, or local environment files.

The final checks require `/v1/config` to return the selected WorkOS client ID and unauthenticated
`/v1/hosts` to return `401`. Verify no migrations remain:

```sh
pnpm --filter @botharness/connect-relay exec wrangler d1 migrations list CONNECT_DB --remote
```

If the final checks fail after deployment, inspect DNS, TLS and the endpoint responses before
rerunning the script: a nonzero exit does not mean the remote deployment was rolled back.
A request using a publicly resolved address with `curl --resolve` retains TLS hostname
verification, but does not prove the machine's default DNS resolver works.

Finally, run `deepseekbot connect-sign-in --wait` against an isolated Host, approve the code in
the browser with an allowlisted application user, and check `deepseekbot connect-status`.
It must report a connected tunnel. The tunnel hostname must reach `/botharness-device/*`,
while `/` and `/api` return `404`. Sign out the disposable Host after verification.
