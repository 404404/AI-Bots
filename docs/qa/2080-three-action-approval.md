# #2080 — three-action approval tracer bullet

Initial continuous pass: `a84f9dd12ac9b890d8a748ca77db3502b4ecdffc` (clean build). Latest-main qualification: `953a77d09b255637e3e016e5e36ece6efcf93fb2` (clean), integrating main `64315272e5247993e2c5569513703d24c2032b49`. Date: 2026-10-20. DSH 0.2.1-rc.2; Windows; native pwsh; real OpenCode Go / deepseek-v4.1-flash; isolated Profile. #2316 remains draft; Human acceptance and merge have not occurred.

## Qualified behavior

The real Web card had exactly **Allow once / Always allow / Reject**. Clicking Always allow saved a current-tool rule for the current Bot, role and authority scope. A changed-input native pwsh call succeeded without another card; bot_create still asked and was rejected. Online CLI revoked the tool rule, a later pwsh call asked again, and CLI Allow once let it produce its real marker.

Explicit chat Full Access let ordinary native pwsh finish without a card. A recognized `grant-write-set` command still asked for Human approval, with Always allow disabled. Reject produced native `denied` / `Human approval was rejected`. No real permission target was modified. Markers required both native successful tool results and committed Bot replies. Client page errors and warnings: none.

The original guard screenshot clipped Reject behind the composer, so it was not published. A second synthetic guard request was captured after scrolling the real Reject action into view, in both themes, and rejected normally. No product state or DOM was fabricated for a screenshot.

## Latest-main qualification and retained limits

The integrated continuous journey passed Web Always allow, current-tool persistence, changed-input native output without another card, other-tool rejection, CLI revoke/Allow once and Full Access ordinary output. Its last step timed out before the thinking model issued a management tool call; no management request existed in native trace. Host doctor remained healthy and observation/failure evidence was preserved. A fresh synthetic Bot on that same clean build then issued the native management call, displayed the disabled-middle Human card in both themes, and recorded native denied after normal rejection; canonical Grants remained zero. This is a qualified separate management case, not a claim that the integrated continuous run passed.

The early mode switch also refused an old-mode Inbox cleanup call while the model was finishing a turn. The verification runner now waits for a settled native turn before changing Full Access. Product permission guards and timeouts were not relaxed. The real initial continuous pass and the later isolated management proof remain separately identified.

Latest-main integration CI [39296414196](https://github.com/BotHarness/DeepSeekBot/actions/runs/39296414196) passed all required checks, including three full test shards, Android native tests, mobile bundles, docs and isolated-Host smoke. Subsequent evidence-only/doc/runner commits still require exact-head CI; consult the PR checks for that final result.

## Automated checks

- Current-tool store: restart persistence, changed inputs, isolation by Bot/role/scope/tool and revocation; legacy exact/broad retention; real generation 103 → 104 migration; top-level Full Access snapshot preserves mode, Grant and revision while moving never → ask.
- Approval coordinator: Human-only mutation skips legacy/current rules and Reviewer; Full Access ordinary answer and execution-time revocation check; decision → persisted rule → changed-input match → other-tool ask → revoke → ask.
- Runtime and Grant policy: root Full Access uses ask; delegated native Subagent policy remains separately owned. Runtime file suite passed 20/20 when run serially, then 21/21 after the latest-main context-overflow addition. A broad concurrent Windows run timed out an unrelated image-read case and hit cleanup EPERM; no timeout was raised.
- Shared Web card, companion, Activity and history regression tests pass. Secret/MCP, Channel approval and operational database checks pass (53 tests). Mobile history recognizes allowed-always-tool (34 conversation tests); no native mobile UI claim.
- CLI decision forwarding passes; Host/Web/mobile typecheck, lint, format and production build pass locally. See the PR checks for exact final-head CI; local tests are not a substitute for that result.

## Limits and recovery

Schema generation 104 is a one-way binary compatibility boundary: an older Host must refuse the newer database. Revoke remembered rules through their owner, restore the desired mode through the existing access setting, and forward recover; do not downgrade by editing SQL. Legacy rules keep their meaning and can be revoked.

This slice covers Channel Web + online CLI with shared-card component checks. It does not qualify native mobile approval UI, new IM rule creation, every Shell Provider or the complete restart/recovery matrix. Directory authorization remains the separate confirmed read/write command from the first slice. #2080 remains open for later slices.

## Copy alignment follow-up (2026-10-20)

The ordinary card now says that Always allow remembers this Bot using this tool in the current authorization scope, including different inputs. The shortcut label uses the same wording and no longer promises a second risk confirmation. Selection submits immediately; the existing mouse-click regression now asserts exactly one persistent decision and no confirmation dialog. No runtime policy, schema or matching boundary changes in this follow-up.

Focused card, companion, Activity, persisted-rule and coordinator tests pass (64 tests). Current copy still needs manual visual acceptance: local browser observation was blocked by browser policy, so no alternate browser surface was used and no new screenshot is claimed. Earlier captures above prove the prior layout/behavior, not the updated wording. On a Host built from the PR head, open the prepared ordinary approval card in Chinese or English, read the scope note, and select Always allow once; verify it submits without another confirmation. Repeat through Activity or the companion, which share this component. The final exact-head CI and runtime qualification are recorded in the PR handoff comment.

## Five-persona Chrome follow-up — incomplete

The Human requested real-key browser QA. A parent-driven Chrome journey created a synthetic Bot through the real model, approved creation, then approved one harmless native pwsh call. The visible accessibility tree contained the real marker reply; another changed-input request was pending in canonical Host state when the browser connection failed. [Captured frames and exact limits](../../.github/pr-screenshots/2080-five-user-qa/README.md) are retained. Five subagents reviewed scenarios/evidence/source; their independent browser drives did not complete. No five-user pass rate is claimed.

The follow-up fixes the observed old onboarding button name; all card surfaces now show submission progress and recover unavailable status through an explicit read-only recheck rather than falsely showing expired. Four regression cases cover initial-read failure, submit/read failure, duplicate clicks, and a committed decision with its response lost. Recheck never automatically resubmits. Full Access description now explicitly distinguishes chat/new Assignments from existing permission snapshots. Focused card, companion, Activity, settings and history checks passed (81 distinct tests, including the final 21-case card suite); typecheck and production build passed. Exact-head CI remains a separate required gate.

Chrome eventually disappeared from the available browser inventory after repeated control timeouts. Host doctor stayed healthy; Client diagnostics recorded an unclassified exception and a shell-lost/remounted event, so console inspection remains unresolved. The current fixes have no after-browser capture yet. 375px/slow-3G, remaining browser journeys and the five-persona rerun are unverified. Do not merge or treat this as completed Human acceptance.
