# ADR-0234: Mobile creation shares the existing tab navigator

- Status: Accepted; native qualification tracked in the issue

## Context

The confirmed mobile design places a contextual creation circle beside the bottom navigation island. SDK 58 NativeTabs exposes a bottom accessory rather than a persistent adjacent action slot. A fake navigation destination or another navigation stack would change Back and tab semantics.

## Decision

Use the already installed Expo Router JS tab navigator on iOS as well as Android, retaining existing Home, Activity and root Stack routes. A shared bar presents two destinations and a separate creation action; a transparent native modal owns dismissal and blocks underlying actions. On iOS, SwiftUI Button controls own navigation and creation taps, the selected capsule uses the native glass button style, and the separate plus/close button uses a circular glass style on iOS 26. A native glass capsule supplies the shared island background; this is app-composed navigation, not UIKit UITabBar. Earlier iOS uses native bordered controls; system Reduce Transparency remains authoritative. Android retains its existing opaque OCAT material and React Native controls. No dependencies, SDK or native inputs change.

Creation resolves stable source keys, never display names. All requires an explicit target. Computer flows carry the selected Host ID into the existing full-client route and refuse a different active Host. Cloud flows carry instance, account scope and Organization ID; refresh identity/ownership before opening the form and again before the mutation. An unmounted or dismissed preflight cannot navigate or initiate creation. Pending cloud creation uses the existing durable idempotency receipt and retries only on explicit action. After creation, navigate directly to the returned channel without concurrently refreshing the directory: channel opening and directory refresh use the same serialized CloudClient. Chats refreshes its directory on focus when the user returns. No new store, API, CLI command, permission or execution authority is introduced.

## Consequences

The iOS tab bar is now app-owned presentation. Native glass support does not prove layout, gestures or accessibility: exact-head shared-queue Simulator checks must qualify adjacent geometry, dismissal, safe area, large text and actual creation. Android, physical-device and screen-reader gates remain independent. The expanded menu uses an opaque readable surface, not an asserted native morph animation. N3 adds Search only with functioning search behavior.
